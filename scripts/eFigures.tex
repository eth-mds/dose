    \caption{Comparison of sedation and imputation options for the central
    nervous system component. In a post-hoc analysis, we inspected the predictive
    performance of three imputation techniques: (i) setting the GCS score to the
    maximal value whenever the patient is sedated; (ii) for the duration of the
    sedation window, using the latest available GCS value prior to the sedation
    window; (iii) ignoring the sedation information and using the raw GCS values
    as recorded in the databases, and two approaches to sedation: (a) medication
    based; (b) RASS based; (c) ignoring sedation. Our findings show that raw GCS
    values with sedation status not taken into account achieve the highest
    marginal AUC for predicting mortality. However, sedation-adjusted values
    (setting the GCS score to 15 based on administration of sedative drugs) are
    used by the data-driven predictive Sepsis SOFA score.}

    \caption{Over-time performance of the data-driven Sepsis SOFA and SOFA scores,
    with the metabolic component of the new score removed. The two scores are
    evaluated in terms of area under receiver operator characteristic (AUROC)
    and area under precision recall (AUPRC) for predicting mortality, during the
    first day of ICU stay, in time steps of 2 hours, with the metabolic component
    of Sepsis SOFA not included. The 95\% confidence intervals for the areas
    under the curve, obtained using bootstrap, are plotted in every subplot. The
    new score still outperforms SOFA in each metric, time point and dataset.}

    \caption{Performance of the data-driven Sepsis SOFA and SOFA scores at 24
    hours into ICU. Each component of Sepsis SOFA is compared to the corresponding
    component of SOFA, by plotting the receiver operator characteristic (ROC)
    curve at 24 hours into ICU stay. Each row of the figure corresponds to an
    organ failure category (cardiovascular, coagulation, hepatic,
    metabolic, renal, respiratory) and each row corresponds to a dataset.
    Sepsis SOFA outperforms SOFA in almost every component and dataset.}

    \caption{Mortality barplots for each component and dataset. For each organ
    failure component, we divide the study cohort into groups of patients who
    had a Sepsis SOFA score of 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 at 24 hours into ICU, and
    calculate the mortality rate in each group. The same was repeated for all
    the values and components of the SOFA score. The mortality rate for each
    group, dataset and component are presented as barplots, where each row of
    the figure corresponds to an organ failure category (cardiovascular,
    coagulation, hepatic, metabolic, renal, respiratory) and each row corresponds
    to a dataset.}

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../figures/score-multiplicity.png}
    \caption{Performance of predictive scores in the ablation analysis.
    The average AUROC at 24 hours into ICU stay on the validation set is reported,
    together with its 95\% confidence interval.
    The score with 0 forbidden features is the optimal score presented in Table 2.
    For each of the six domains (excluding neurological),
    we reconstructed a predictive score with the most predictive feature forbidden
    (yielding six scores with 1 forbidden feature).
    Then, we listed any combination of 2 most predictive features, and constructed
    scores which did not use these features. This was continued until, finally,
    we constructed a score that was forbidden to use any of the features appearing
    in the original optimal score in Table 2. The figure indicates that even
    removing several of the optimal features still yields a relatively good predictive
    performance of the score.}

    (MIMIC-IV, AUMC), we compute the Sepsis SOFA values. Based on
    these, we fit a logistic regression model (death ~ Sepsis SOFA +
    Intercept), and the fitted probabilities are used as predicted probabilities.
    The fitted probabilities are then assessed for calibration on the validation
    cohorts (MIMIC-IV, AUMC, SICdb).}
