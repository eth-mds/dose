# A Framework and Analytical Exploration for a Data-Driven Update of the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Score in Sepsis

This repository contains all the code that was used to develop the
data-driven Sepsis SOFA score, in the paper "
A Framework and Analytical Exploration for a Data-Driven Update of the Sequential 
Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Score in Sepsis" by D. Plecko, N. Bennett, I.F. Ukor, N. Rodemund,

All of the code used for reproducing the analyses can be found in the `scripts/`
folder. Data loading was performed using the [ricu R-package](https://github.com/eth-mds/ricu).
Installation of dependencies in `r/zzz-deps.R` is also required. For each of the
figures/tables appearing in the manuscript, the `main.R` file contains a pointer
to the corresponding script that generates it, and allows the user to reproduce
the result.
